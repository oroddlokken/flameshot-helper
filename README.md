# Flameshot helper for automatic uploads with SFTP

I miss ShareX

Move `flameshot-helper-example.json` to `~/.config/oroddlokken/flameshot-helper.json` and edit the values.  

I added a custom shortcut to KDE that makes `ctrl+shift+prtscrn` run this script.

## Features:
  - Save screenshots in a local folder
  - Upload screenshots to a remote host
  - Generate a URL for the upload screenshot
  - Copy the URL to clipboard
  - Send a KDE notification when the screenshot is uploaded
